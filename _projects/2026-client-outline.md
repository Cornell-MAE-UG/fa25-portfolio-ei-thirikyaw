# SLF Crushers Client Outline

**Team:** SLF Crushers 
 Alice Park, Nayana Zachariah, Connor Hyde, Serkan Yurday, Ei Thiri Kyaw
**Client(s):** Cornell CALS Extension / E\&J Gallo Winery / National Grape  

## Problem statement (most important)
Vineyard growers face severe spotted lanternfly (SLF) infestations during the final 3 months before harvest, when grape sugar content is highest and fruit is most vulnerable. SLF cluster on vines and fruit, feeding on sap and producing honeydew that promotes mold and reduces yield. In heavily infested regions, losses can reach 30–50%, often requiring repeated pesticide applications that increase labor and chemical costs. However, current removal methods—such as shaking, suction, brushing, or high-force airflow—risk damaging grapes or interfering with harvesting machinery, leaving no effective way to remove SLF during harvest without harming the crop.

## Impact
We chose to address the problem of removing spotted lanternflies from grapevines without harming the plants. Because these insects feed on sap, they weaken vines and reduce fruit yield. However, any removal method that damages leaves, stems, or fruit would also lower production. Therefore, our prototype focuses on eliminating spotted lanternflies while preserving grapevine health to support optimal grape production.


## Proposed direction(s) 
The long-term vision for this product is a cylindrical unit approximately the height of vineyard trellises and roughly two feet in diameter, with scalable dimensions depending on the size and needs of the operation. The system would operate autonomously, continuously rotating to guide and trap insects drawn toward the device. By the end of the semester, we would like to produce a mini replica of our product. We can 3D print external parts, utilize servo motors, lace the interior with the attractive solution, and program the system to operate at the speed intended. This prototype will allow us to validate the mechanical design, examine the efficiency of trapping, and verify the operational feasibility.

### Concept A (primary): <Sensor Activated Vacuum Rotating Lure Extermination Device>

**What it is:** <Our device will use scents, sound frequencies, and sugary sap to lure spotted lanternflies away from the vines and into the trap. >  
**How it would be used:** <1.1. Using attractants, spotted lanternflies will either enter the trap or trigger a motion sensor that activates a low pressure vacuum to pull them inside. 2. A rotating blade guides them toward the center of the trap. 3. Continued rotation forces them downward through the center into the execution chamber. 4. A second rotating blade in the chamber kills the spotted lanternflies. >  
**Why it’s better than the status quo:** <1. It is a promising idea to remove them from the grape vines 2. It would be very easy to install and very low maintenance.>  
**End-of-semester proof-of-concept:** <On the mechanical side, we can design and build most of the trap, except for the vacuum system, which may be difficult given our budget and resources. We are also uncertain about the attractants. Although we can research sounds, scents, or flavors that draw SLF, we likely cannot conduct our own experiments on that aspect.>  

<Only include if you want the client to compare two directions. Keep short.>
## Key risks/unknowns [Serkan]

- Risk 1: Competitive Attraction. Natural grapevine phloem may outperform the artificial lure during ripening. Test: Conduct a 24-hour choice test between a high-sugar plant and the lure to determine the capture efficiency ratio.
Risk 2: SLF Evasion. The rotating mechanism might trigger a flight response. Test: Use video analysis to identify the optimal rotational speed that minimizes startle-induced jumping or flying.
Risk 3: Threshold Failure. Near-total capture is required as only two SLF can cause bin rejection. Test: Place the trap in a closed grapevine system for three weeks and perform a manual count to verify 100% capture.

## Questions for the client
1. Vineyard Spacing: What are the specific dimensions between rows? This determines if traps can be placed within the vineyard or must be restricted to the perimeter to avoid interfering with harvesters.
2. Manual Labor: Is on-site labor available to move traps during harvest? This determines whether the units need to be fixed-position or portable.
3. Certifications: Does the vineyard hold organic or food-grade certifications? This determines which chemical lures or artificial scents are permissible under your regulatory standards.
