title: Actuator Project

Task:
Given a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a rigid bar of a fixed length (your choice), 3 pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground and a linear actuator (pick from this online catalog, use max force values only), design a
frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height. Assume all the supports and bar/actuator are rigid.

Selected Actuator: IMA55 RN05
Force up to 35.81 kN
Stroke Length: 0.5 cm

It can't be on either edge of the rod because if you place the actuator at point O the system will have a higher height but it can't withstand as much weight. However, if you place the actuatir on the right edge, the height is limited by the actuator's length.
